I got a sweet deal on this antenna. I don't know that the general public has much use for it, but that didn't stop me from throwing money at this guy!

In addition to the AV 2011, I was given, that's right, GIVEN an AT-197/GR Discone antenna. After a little bit of digging the antenna seems to have been originally used for ground-based communication with aircraft. Unfortunately there were no elements attached. Keep an eye out for a future project regarding this deficiency.
